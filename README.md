Context Setting & introduction
Explain the expectations of the evaluator from the assignment 
Showing knowledge and other awareness while implementing specific asks
How to build intuition and build a solution from scratch even when you have never dealt with a similar situation in the past
Agenda overview
System Flow Discussion
Home Screen Movie Display
Why React & NOT Vanilla JS?
Data Structure for layout and storing seat-related info
Seat selection UI
Constraints and discussion
Problem Statement Discussion
This would mostly be a live coding session, where I will build a React app from scratch with them
Start with a general React installation and setup the intro 
Data Schema discussion followed by Sample data JSON file construction and how it will be consumed by different components
The approach is as follows:
Home Page component
List All Movie Shows
Booking Flow complex component- 
At least 4 to 5 sub-component
Ability to select a show from multiple shows for a particular movie
Ability to select a seat type & quantity
Seat Layout
Seat Component with all the configuration setup- Available, Unavailable, Selected Highlighting


Approach 
Ask clarifying questions
VVIP: Discuss Edge cases
Take a few breaks in between and make sure you are on the same with the interviewer
Not necessary to solve the complete problem, but focus on the important stuff and ask the interviewer if they want you to explain/implement the basic stuff as well
Give examples from real-world and connect the dots on how a feature can add value to people’s life
Pseudo Code Sharing + Interview Strategy
Start with comments
Pseudocode !== Actual code, mind the gap, and don’t start explaining and implementing the actual stuff
Variable naming is more important than you think!
Make sure that you are not missing out on key things that the assignment mentioned, comments can actually help you in translating plain English into Pseudocode
A dry run always helps and is essential for both of you(You and the Interviewer).
